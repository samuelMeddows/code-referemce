<p>East of Haputale, a 10 km <small>scenic</small> road along the edge of the escarpment through beautiful rambling tea estates to leads us to legendary Dambatenna Tea Factory, built in 1890 by Sir Thomas Lipton, the tea magnate whose name is immortalized in Lipton's Tea. The colonial Dambatenne Tea Factory brings in an unmistakable message of philanthropy in addition to the efficient industry: the workers' quarters of the famous factory accommodates over 4,000 people; the 20,000 sq ft factory employee 1,600 workers. At the entrance is a quote from John Ruskin: "Quality is no accident. It is the result of intelligent effort." In spite of the on-going modernization, some of the machinery of the colonial era is still in operation in this ISO certified factory.
