<p> The float property instructs the browser to ignore the normal position of the element in the document flow and to place it on the left or right side of the content.</p>
<p class="clear">The clear property has the opposite behavior. It instructs the browser not to allow floats on the specified side, or on both sides. When clear is set to “none”, floats can be placed on either side of the element. When it is set to left, floats cannot be positioned to the left of the content. Floats appear either above or beneath the element in these cases.</p>
