Skiing on the south facing slopes is limited as they are dominated by large granite "Crags". There are several lines that appear skiable from the relative safety of Alice Rawson Peak but most (including myself) would be scared off by the view down them from above. The rocky nature of the southern slopes of the Crags means they require a good to snow cover before they become skiable.

The easiest line on offer follows Crags Creek, located in the gully between Watson’s Crags and The Awesome Spur. I’ve only scoped this out from a nearby ridge and from the air but it appears to be wide enough and relatively hazard free for most advanced skiers. Like all the slopes off the south side of the Crags its not possible to see what awaits from above. The slope has a similar grade to the runs down the western face of Twynam West Spur. The easiest way to exit the run would be to skin/hike back up the creek.

Crags Creek is probably the only line I'm willing to say is accessible to the average backcountry skier. The rest really is expert terrain. If you were going to attempt these slopes you'd need to check them out from a vantage point first. The Awesome Spur, Carruthers West Spur and Alice Rawson Peak are probably the best vantage points for these runs. You'd probably also want to carry some basic mountaineering equipment for the hike back to the top. I've looked down most of these slopes from above and the assessment on all occasions has been that they are unskiable (at least for my ability level).
